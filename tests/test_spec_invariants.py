"""BFS implementation check against the TLA+ spec at formal/audit.tla.

For every (Package, Pins) tuple drawn from the same finite state space
as the TLA+ model, this test:

    1. Computes the spec verdict via `audit_spec()` — a Python mirror
       of the TLA+ `Audit` operator.
    2. Materialises the abstract package as a JSON file (minting real
       Sigstore bundles via Fulcio + Rekor when CI OIDC is available;
       skipping bundle-present rows otherwise) and runs the actual
       `mipiti-verify audit` command.
    3. Classifies the CLI output into a Verdict label.
    4. Asserts the implementation's verdict agrees with the spec, and
       independently asserts each security invariant I1–I7 on the
       implementation's output.

The BFS is the regression gate: any change to `cli.py` that breaks
an invariant produces a failed parametrised test naming the exact
abstract (pkg, pins) tuple that violated it — the same kind of
counterexample TLC would emit.

CI Fulcio integration:
    The test detects whether the CI runner has OIDC token access
    (GitHub Actions with `id-token: write` permission, exposed via
    ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL + _TOKEN env vars) and uses
    `sigstore.sign.SigningContext` to mint a real Fulcio-signed bundle
    once per session. Bundle-present rows of the BFS use this real
    bundle, parameterised over (results_hash binding, auditor pin
    SAN/issuer combos). Locally — or in any CI run without OIDC
    permission — bundle-present rows skip and only no-bundle rows
    execute.

State space: 4 SANs × 3 issuers × 3 fingerprints × ~6 package shapes
(no-bundle) + ~4 bundle shapes when OIDC is available. ~1800–2200
total parametrised rows. Runs in a few seconds locally, ~30s in CI
with the Fulcio mint amortised across rows.
