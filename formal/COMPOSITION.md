# Compositional Verification of `audit.tla`

The audit-envelope verifier's correctness is verified compositionally
across two TLC configurations:

- **Config 1** — pins `bundle_bind_hash` and `bundle_bind_signature`
  to their canonical "matching, valid" representative (`bundle_bind_hash =
  bundle.bound_hash`, `bundle_bind_signature = TRUE`). Verifies invariants
  whose truth value is independent of `bundle_bind_*` on that
  representative: I1–I7, I9–I13, V3, V5a–V5c. Realized as **five
  per-`key_source` sub-configs** (`audit_main_sigstore.cfg`,
  `audit_main_platform.cfg`, `audit_main_workspace.cfg`,
  `audit_main_cdsse.cfg`, `audit_main_orphan_legacy.cfg`) whose
  `allowedKS` sets union to `KeySources` exactly and are pairwise
  disjoint (mechanically checked by
  `formal/check_audit_partition_total.py`). Each sub-config invokes
  the same `ConfigMainInvariants`, `AuditView`, and bundle_bind
  pinning; the partition is lossless because every invariant is a
  per-`(pkg, pins)`-row predicate and `key_source` is a property of
  the row. See **"Config-1 per-`key_source` sub-split (lossless)"**
  below for the per-invariant × per-sub-config coverage argument.
- **`audit_bundle_bind.cfg`** — explores the full `bundle_bind_*` cross-
  product AND the full `ws_sig` variation (V1/V2's preconditions
  require `ws_sig` present with specific `key_source` values). Pins
  all auditor pins to `NONE`, since V1/V2's premises require this and
  I8/I14 are pin-independent. Verifies I8, I14, V1, V2.

The conjunction of both configs' invariants is logically equivalent to
the un-split `audit.cfg`'s `SecurityInvariants`, *if* the partition
argument below holds. The partition argument is itself
machine-checked: `audit_main.cfg` includes a `ConfigMainCompositionLemma`
that mechanically validates the pinning is precision-preserving for
each invariant in Config 1.

## Why split

The full-domain TLC enumeration runs on `~95M` distinct states
post-symmetry. Each new field on `Package` multiplies the state space.
After explicit `bundle_bind_hash` and `bundle_bind_signature` were
added, single-config TLC takes ~23 minutes per CI run.

State-space cost is multiplicative, but invariants only depend on
subsets of the dimensions. Splitting turns a multiplication into a
sum:

```
Single config:  bundle × ws_sig × pins × bundle_bind ≈ 95M states
Config 1:       bundle × ws_sig × pins × {pinned}    ≈ 10M states
Config 2:       bundle × {pinned} × {pinned} × bundle_bind ≈ 30K states
Total split:    ~10M states (roughly 10× reduction)
```

## Partition argument

Each invariant in `audit.tla` has a **dependency footprint** — the set
of fields its premise and conclusion reference, transitively through
`Audit`. The partition is sound iff every invariant lives in a config
whose state-space exploration covers its dependency footprint.

### Invariants in Config 1 (pinned `bundle_bind`)

These invariants are bundle_bind-independent under the canonical-
matching pinning:

| Invariant | Why bundle_bind doesn't affect its truth value |
|---|---|
| `I1_SanPinIsBinding` | Premise references `pins.san`/`model_id`/`commit_sha` and `bundle = ABSENT`. Conclusion: `Audit ∈ {FAILED, USAGE_ERROR}`. Bundle-absent states have `bundle_bind` already pinned to `NONE/NONE` in `InitBase`. Bundle-present states satisfy the premise vacuously (`bundle ≠ ABSENT`), so the implication holds trivially. |
| `I2_WorkspacePinIsBinding` | Premise: `pins.workspace_fp ≠ NONE` AND `ws_sig = ABSENT`. Conclusion: `Audit ∈ {FAILED, USAGE_ERROR}`. Independent of `bundle_bind`: the workspace-pin-without-ws_sig case fires `Audit = FAILED` via the I2 branch in `Audit`, not the bundle-bind branches. |
| `I3_IssuerNeverSelfAttested` | Premise references `pins.san`, `bundle ≠ ABSENT`, `ResolveIssuer(pins) ≠ NONE`, `bundle.issuer ≠ ResolveIssuer`. Conclusion: `Audit = FAILED`. The bundle-issuer-mismatch branch fires before the bundle-bind branches in `Audit`'s ordering, so `bundle_bind` is irrelevant. |
| `I4_WorkspaceFpBound` | Premise: `pins.workspace_fp ≠ NONE` AND `ws_sig ≠ ABSENT` AND `ws_sig.signing_key_fp ≠ pins.workspace_fp`. Conclusion: `Audit ∈ {FAILED, USAGE_ERROR}`. The workspace-fp-mismatch branch in `Audit` is independent of `bundle_bind`. |
| `I5_VerifiedImpliesEvidence` | Premise: `Audit = VERIFIED`. For `Audit = VERIFIED`, the bundle-bind branches must NOT have fired (else FAILED), so `bundle_bind` is in the canonical-matching state. Pinning to that state in Config 1 covers all `Audit = VERIFIED` reachable states. |
| `I6_ContentHashBoundToResults` | Premise: `Audit ∈ {VERIFIED, PARTIALLY_VERIFIED}` and `results_hash ≠ NONE`. Same `Audit = positive ⇒ bundle_bind matching` argument as I5. |
| `I7_SanRequiredForCoPins` | Premise: `pins.san = NONE` AND co-pin set. Conclusion: `Audit = USAGE_ERROR`. The USAGE_ERROR branch fires first in `Audit` (before any bundle-bind logic), so `bundle_bind` is irrelevant. |
| `I9_AllPresentSignaturesValid` | Premise: `Audit = VERIFIED`. Same `Audit = VERIFIED ⇒ bundle_bind matching` argument as I5. |
| `I10_UnboundBundleNotVerified` | Premise: `bundle ≠ ABSENT` AND `results_hash = NONE`. Conclusion: `Audit ∈ {UNVERIFIED, FAILED, USAGE_ERROR}`. The bundle-without-results_hash branch in `Audit` is structurally orthogonal to `bundle_bind` (it fires before the bind check). |
| `I11_BundleSanMatchesPin` | Premise: `Audit = VERIFIED` AND `bundle ≠ ABSENT` AND `pins.san ≠ NONE`. Same `Audit = VERIFIED ⇒ bundle_bind matching` argument. |
| `I12_BundleModelIdMatchesPin` | Same `Audit = VERIFIED ⇒ bundle_bind matching` argument. |
| `I13_BundleCommitShaMatchesPin` | Same `Audit = VERIFIED ⇒ bundle_bind matching` argument. |
| `V3_OrphanWithWorkspacePinFails` | Premise: `ws_sig.key_source = KS_ORPHAN` AND `pins.workspace_fp ≠ NONE` (no other pins set). Conclusion: `Audit ∈ {FAILED, USAGE_ERROR}`. The orphan + workspace-pin branch in `Audit` is independent of `bundle_bind` — fires before the bundle-bind check on bundle-present states; on bundle-absent states `bundle_bind` is already NONE. |

### Invariants in Config 2 (full `bundle_bind` cross-product)

These invariants explicitly reference `bundle_bind_hash` and/or
`bundle_bind_signature` in their premise or conclusion:

| Invariant | Reason |
|---|---|
| `I8_BundleBoundToBundleBindHash` | Conclusion: `bundle.bound_hash = bundle_bind_hash`. Must explore states where they differ. |
| `I14_BundleBindExplicit` | Conclusion: `bundle_bind_hash ≠ NONE` AND `bundle.bound_hash = bundle_bind_hash`. Same. |
| `V1_SigstoreSkipSoundness` | Premise: `bundle ≠ ABSENT` AND `bundle_bind_hash = bundle.bound_hash` AND `bundle_bind_signature ∉ {INVALID, KEY_UNRESOLVABLE}`. Must explore the full domain to confirm the conclusion holds on all premise-satisfying states. |
| `V2_OrphanWithBundleVerified` | Same as V1 with `KS_ORPHAN`. |
| `V4_BundleBindSigKeyResolutionExplicit` | Premise: `bundle ≠ ABSENT` AND `bundle_bind_signature = KEY_UNRESOLVABLE`. Conclusion: `Audit ∈ {FAILED, USAGE_ERROR}`. Directly references the `bundle_bind_signature` domain. |

Config 2 pins all auditor pins (`pins.san`, `issuer_explicit`,
`workspace_fp`, `model_id`, `commit_sha`) to `NONE`. Reason: V1/V2's
premises explicitly require all pins NONE; I8/I14's premise/conclusion
don't reference pins. Pinning is precision-preserving for these four
invariants.

`ws_sig` varies fully in Config 2 — V1's premise requires `ws_sig`
present with `key_source = KS_SIGSTORE`, V2's with `key_source =
KS_ORPHAN`. Without `ws_sig` variation Config 2 cannot exercise those
preconditions.

## Machine-checked composition lemma

`audit_main.cfg` includes `ConfigMainCompositionLemma` (defined in
`audit.tla`):

```tla
ConfigMainCompositionLemma ==
    pkg.bundle # ABSENT =>
      \A bb_hash \in (Hashes \cup {NONE}) :
        \A bb_sig \in (BOOLEAN \cup {NONE}) :
          LET pkg_alt == [pkg EXCEPT
                            !.bundle_bind_hash = bb_hash,
                            !.bundle_bind_signature = bb_sig]
          IN  \/ Audit(pkg_alt, pins) \in {"FAILED", "USAGE_ERROR"}
              \/ Audit(pkg_alt, pins) = Audit(pkg, pins)
```

For every state Config 1 explores, this asserts that altering
`bundle_bind` either (a) lands in the negative verdict class via the
bundle-bind branch, or (b) preserves `Audit`'s verdict. Together with
the pinning, this mechanically validates that Config 1's enumeration
loses no invariant violations to the bundle_bind dimension.

If TLC reports "Model checking completed. No error has been found"
on `audit_main.cfg`, both:

1. Config 1's invariants hold on every state in the pinned domain,
   AND
2. The pinning is compositionally sound — no full-domain violation
   could exist that Config 1's enumeration missed.

## Equivalence claim

If TLC accepts all five `audit_main_*.cfg` sub-configs **and**
`audit_bundle_bind.cfg`, then the conjunction of all invariants in
`SecurityInvariants` holds on `audit.tla`'s reachable state space.
(The five sub-configs realize Config 1's per-`key_source` partition;
their union — total + disjoint, mechanically verified by
`formal/check_audit_partition_total.py` — covers `audit_main.cfg`'s
historical state space exactly.)

The original un-split `audit.cfg` (full-domain `Init == InitBase(TRUE)`,
all invariants in one run) has been **deleted** along with its
now-dead `Init` / `Spec` operators in `audit.tla`. The five
`audit_main_*.cfg` sub-configs + `audit_bundle_bind.cfg` collectively
cover its state space exactly (totality + disjointness mechanically
verified); keeping an unexercised aggregate cfg invited silent rot —
no CI ran it, so a future change that broke it without breaking the
sub-configs would never be detected.

## Config-2 customer_dsse exclusion (lossless)

`Init_bind` (Config 2's init operator, selected by
`audit_bundle_bind.cfg` via `SPECIFICATION Spec_bind`) calls the
parameterised `InitBase(genCustomerDsse)` with `genCustomerDsse =
FALSE`. `InitBase(FALSE)` enumerates `pkg \in PackageGen(FALSE)`,
whose `WSSigGen(FALSE)` generator **drops `KS_CUSTOMER_DSSE` from the
`key_source` domain and pins the three customer_dsse-only WSSig
fields to singletons**:

```tla
key_source                : KeySources \ {KS_CUSTOMER_DSSE}
dsse_predicate_model_id   : {NONE}
dsse_predicate_commit_sha : {NONE}
customer_key_fp_match     : {TRUE}
```

i.e. **Config 2 never generates a customer_dsse row** — and, because
this is a smaller *enumerated set* (not a post-`\in` filter), TLC's
init-state generator never materialises the customer_dsse
sub-product (~18× fewer WSSig records: `3·3·2` collapsed to `1·1·1`,
`KeySources` 6→5). `Init_main` (Config 1) and the legacy `Init` call
`InitBase(TRUE)`, where `PackageGen(TRUE)` is byte-equivalent to the
original `Package` (customer_dsse fully generated). Note
`PackageGen(FALSE) ⊆ Package`, so `TypeOK == pkg \in Package` still
holds on every Config-2 state. A *bare conjunctive* exclusion
(`… /\ pkg.ws_sig.key_source # KS_CUSTOMER_DSSE`) layered after an
unparameterised `pkg \in Package` was measured **not** to prune
generation — TLC iterates the full record product first and only
then discards — which is the init-generation blow-up the AuditView /
InitBase-canon work documents; the generator-set restriction is what
actually prunes.

This is *lossless* — it removes only states on which every invariant
Config 2 checks is vacuously true:

- The exact invariant set Config 2 verifies is
  `ConfigBindInvariants` = **`I8`, `I14`, `V1`, `V2`, `V4`** (plus
  `TypeOK`). This is the machine-checked list — `audit.tla`'s
  `ConfigBindInvariants` body — not a prose restatement.
- **Every one of `I8`, `I14`, `V1`, `V2`, `V4` has a premise conjunct
  requiring `pkg.bundle # ABSENT`** (I8: `… /\ pkg.bundle # ABSENT`;
  I14: `Audit = VERIFIED /\ pkg.bundle # ABSENT`; V1/V2:
  `… /\ pkg.bundle # ABSENT /\ pkg.bundle.valid …`; V4:
  `pkg.bundle # ABSENT /\ bundle_bind_signature = KEY_UNRESOLVABLE`).
  `TypeOK` is a pure type predicate that holds on every well-typed
  state regardless.
- A customer_dsse row has **`pkg.bundle = ABSENT`** — the
  KeySourceResolver `R12` producer constraint imported into
  `InitBase` (the clause `pkg.ws_sig.key_source = KS_CUSTOMER_DSSE
  => pkg.bundle = ABSENT /\ pkg.ws_sig.valid = TRUE`).
- Therefore on **every** customer_dsse state, all five Config-2
  invariant premises are vacuously false ⇒ each invariant holds
  trivially. Customer_dsse states contribute **zero** invariant
  coverage to Config 2.

This is the *same* partition argument that already places the
customer_dsse positive properties (`V5a`/`V5b`/`V5c`) in **Config
1's** partition: customer_dsse rows are bundle-absent, hence
`bundle_bind`-pinned `NONE/NONE`, hence Config-1 territory.
`Init_main` (Config 1) is **unchanged** and still generates
customer_dsse — `V5a`/`V5b`/`V5c` legitimately need it, and Config
1's sound full run stands.

**Soundness gate (verified before adopting the exclusion).** The
transitive operator closure of `ConfigBindInvariants`/`TypeOK` (the
same call-graph the AST proof in `check_audit_view_faithful.py`
walks) reaches `KS_CUSTOMER_DSSE` / `dsse_predicate_*` /
`customer_key_fp_match` / `IsCustomerDsse` **only** through the
shared, invariant-agnostic `Audit` / `WSSig` / `KeySources`
infrastructure. **No Config-2 invariant body itself** references any
customer_dsse symbol, nor does any Config-2 invariant observe the
customer_dsse `Audit` terminal-dispatch outcome (each requires
`bundle # ABSENT`, which customer_dsse — being bundle-absent — can
never satisfy, so the customer_dsse branch of `Audit` is unreachable
on any state where a Config-2 premise is non-vacuous). The exclusion
is sound.

Effect (measured, `eclipse-temurin:21-jre`, `-Xmx8g -workers auto`,
TLC 2.19): Config 2 (`audit_bundle_bind.cfg`) **completes** —
`Model checking completed. No error has been found.` — in
**3 min 37 s**, **142,743 distinct states** (1,272,102 generated).
Before this change Config 2 did not terminate (stuck in init-state
generation past 2 h with the customer_dsse cross-product
materialised). Config 1 at that time was the monolithic
`audit_main.cfg` (~1 h run, byte-unchanged by the customer_dsse
exclusion since its spec call `InitBase(TRUE)` is a no-op refactor:
`PackageGen(TRUE) ≡ Package`). Config 1 has since been further
sub-split per `key_source` (see "Config-1 per-`key_source` sub-split"
below); `audit_main.cfg` is deleted and the five
`audit_main_*.cfg` sub-configs run in parallel.

The reduction is orthogonal to (and composes with) the `AuditView`
VIEW and the `InitBase` relation-class canonicalisation: those make
the *retained* customer_dsse states tractable for Config 1; this
exclusion removes the *vacuous* ones from Config 2 entirely.

## Config-1 per-`key_source` sub-split (lossless)

Even after the AuditView reduction + the generation-time canonical-
representative pinning, Config 1 still enumerates every `key_source`
class together — so the bundle/ws_sig cross-product for
`{KS_SIGSTORE, KS_PLATFORM, KS_WORKSPACE, KS_CUSTOMER_DSSE,
KS_ORPHAN, KS_LEGACY}` is realized in a single TLC run. The
dominant cost in that run is the multi-class `ws_sig.key_source`
enumeration: each `key_source` value multiplies the WSSig × Package
cross-product, and the AuditView only collapses *observation* — it
does not reduce *generation*.

Config 1 is partitioned by `pkg.ws_sig.key_source` into five
sub-configs, each invoked with the same `ConfigMainInvariants`,
`AuditView`, and bundle_bind pinning as the original
`audit_main.cfg`:

| Sub-config                          | `allowedKS`                       |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `audit_main_sigstore.cfg`           | `{KS_SIGSTORE}`                   |
| `audit_main_platform.cfg`           | `{KS_PLATFORM}`                   |
| `audit_main_workspace.cfg`          | `{KS_WORKSPACE}`                  |
| `audit_main_cdsse.cfg`              | `{KS_CUSTOMER_DSSE}`              |
| `audit_main_orphan_legacy.cfg`      | `{KS_ORPHAN, KS_LEGACY}`          |

Each `audit_main_<class>.cfg` selects a `Spec_main_<class>` →
`Init_main_<class>`, which calls `InitBaseFor(<allowedKS>)`.
`InitBaseFor` is the set-parameterized generalization of the
original boolean `InitBase(genCustomerDsse)`; `PackageGenFor` /
`WSSigGenFor` likewise generalize the row generators. The original
`InitBase(genCustomerDsse)` / `PackageGen(gen)` / `WSSigGen(gen)`
operators are preserved byte-equivalently as thin boolean wrappers,
so `Init` (legacy `audit.cfg`) and `Init_bind` (Config 2) continue
to work unchanged.

### Cdsse generator pre-pinning (`PackageGenForCdsse`)

`Init_main_cdsse` is the exception: instead of
`InitBaseFor({KS_CUSTOMER_DSSE})` it uses a specialized
`PackageGenForCdsse` that lifts the R12 producer constraint
(a customer_dsse row has `bundle = ABSENT`) and the bundle-absent
dead-field pins (`bundle_bind_hash = NONE`, `bundle_bind_signature
= NONE` when `bundle = ABSENT`) into the row generator instead of
post-enumeration filters. This eliminates ~3,800× the Package
cross-product on the cdsse sub-config (the residual init-generation
bottleneck after the per-`key_source` split), taking it from
~270k generated / 26k distinct / ~9 min to ~108k generated / 9k
distinct / ~1 s locally.

**Soundness — what `PackageGenForCdsse` does and doesn't change:**

| `ws_sig` | `bundle` | Generic cdsse | Pre-pinned cdsse | Covered elsewhere? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `cdsse` (`key_source = KS_CUSTOMER_DSSE`) | `ABSENT` (R12) | yes | yes | only cdsse — preserved |
| `cdsse` | `≠ ABSENT` | rejected by R12 post-filter | rejected by gen | n/a (never reachable) |
| `ABSENT` | `ABSENT` | yes | yes | also covered by all 4 other sub-configs |
| `ABSENT` | `≠ ABSENT` | yes | **dropped** | **covered by sigstore + platform + workspace + orphan_legacy** |

The only case actually removed from cdsse enumeration is
(`ws_sig = ABSENT`, `bundle ≠ ABSENT`). These are NOT customer_dsse
rows — `ws_sig = ABSENT` has no `key_source` field, so R12's premise
(`ws_sig ≠ ABSENT ∧ key_source = KS_CUSTOMER_DSSE`) is false on
them, and the customer_dsse-specific invariants V5a/V5b/V5c are
vacuous there anyway. The universal invariants (I1–I13, V3) on
(`ws_sig = ABSENT`, `bundle ≠ ABSENT`) rows are still checked — by
each of the four non-cdsse sub-configs, whose
`PackageGenFor(<class>)` includes `ws_sig: WSSigGenFor(<class>) ∪
{ABSENT}` and `bundle: Bundle ∪ {ABSENT}` and therefore enumerates
the cross-product (`ws_sig = ABSENT`, `bundle = anything`). The
empirical proof: sigstore's distinct-state count (179,064) is
bit-exact unchanged before and after introducing the cdsse
pre-pinning, confirming its enumeration of the
(`ws_sig = ABSENT`, `bundle ≠ ABSENT`) rows is intact.

The mechanical totality check `check_audit_partition_total.py`
recognizes `Init_main_cdsse`'s specialized generator via a small
hardcoded mapping (`_SPECIALIZED_GENERATORS`); the totality +
disjointness assertions still cover the partition exactly. Adding
a new specialized generator in the future requires extending that
mapping — a single explicit, reviewable surface that prevents an
unaccounted-for generator from silently breaking the partition
claim.

**Lossless by construction.** Every invariant in
`ConfigMainInvariants` (and `TypeOK`) is a per-`(pkg, pins)`-row
predicate — its truth value on a given row depends only on that
row's own fields and the auditor's pins, never on other rows or
on rows' pairings. (This is the same per-row property that
`check_audit_view_faithful.py` mechanically verifies as the
prerequisite for the AuditView reduction; it is intrinsic to the
invariants' shape, not a partition-specific premise.) Because
`key_source` is a property of the row, partitioning by
`pkg.ws_sig.key_source`:

  1. enumerates each reachable row in **exactly one** sub-config —
     the one whose `allowedKS` contains the row's class;
  2. checks **every** invariant in `ConfigMainInvariants` on each
     enumerated row — invariants whose premise excludes the class
     are vacuously true on those rows, contributing zero coverage
     but not changing the verdict.

Item (1) is the *partition* property; item (2) is the *coverage*
property. Together they make the union of the five sub-configs'
state-spaces equivalent — under the per-row invariant property —
to the historical un-split `audit_main.cfg` state-space (now
deleted).

The partition mechanics (totality of `allowedKS` union over
`KeySources`, pairwise disjointness of the per-sub-config
`allowedKS` sets) are mechanically verified by
**`formal/check_audit_partition_total.py`**. The check fails closed
with a precise diagnostic if any `key_source` value is uncovered
(a row of that class would never be enumerated by any sub-config)
or if two sub-configs share a class (wasted coverage). Non-vacuity
is established empirically by an operator-injected gap (deleting a
sub-config, or removing a class from an `Init_main_<class>`'s
`allowedKS`) firing the corresponding assertion.

**The original `audit_main.cfg` has been deleted**, along with its
now-dead `Init_main` / `Spec_main` operators in `audit.tla`. The five
sub-configs **are** Config 1 — keeping an unexercised aggregate cfg
around invites silent rot (no CI exercises it, so a future change
that breaks the aggregate but not the sub-configs is undetected).
The mechanical totality + disjointness check + the per-row invariant
property are what make the sub-split sound; re-running the aggregate
would only duplicate work the partition already provably covers.

## Scenario-knob slices (V6..V12)

Three new state variables — `has_orphan_results`, `is_model_only`,
`sufficiency_state` — model the verdict-affecting behaviour added
across PR #249 (require-attestation flag — runner-side only, no
audit-side invariant), PR #254 (MODEL_ONLY verdict for unverified-
model PDFs), and PR #258 (orphan-results fail-close + pending-
sufficiency demotion). Each variable is pinned to a canonical
"nominal" default (`FALSE` / `FALSE` / `SUFF_NA`) in every existing
cfg via `DefaultScenarioPins` in `InitBaseConstraints`, so the
existing Config-1 and Config-2 state spaces are byte-equivalent to
the pre-extension TLC runs.

The new invariants V6..V12 are verified in four dedicated cfgs that
each vary ONE scenario variable and pin the others to defaults:

| cfg                                          | varies            | `AllowOrphanResults` | invariants exercised |
|---|---|---|---|
| `audit_main_orphan_results_blocked.cfg`      | `has_orphan_results` | `FALSE`              | V8, V9 (fail-closed branch) |
| `audit_main_orphan_results_allowed.cfg`      | `has_orphan_results` | `TRUE`               | V9 (override branch) |
| `audit_main_model_only.cfg`                  | `is_model_only`     | `FALSE`              | V10, V11, V12 |
| `audit_main_sufficiency.cfg`                 | `sufficiency_state` | `FALSE`              | V6, V7 |

Splitting the orphan-results scenario across two cfgs by
`AllowOrphanResults` value follows the "BOOLEAN scenarios live in
separate .cfgs" pattern — cheaper than letting TLC explore both
flag values in one run. The envelope state space is tightly
constrained in each scenario cfg (bundle = ABSENT, ws_sig present
and valid, results_hash bound) since the scenario invariants
observe envelope state only via the abstract `AuditEnvelope`
verdict, never via individual envelope fields. Per-cfg wall-clock
is ~4–5s.

Soundness of the partition (the scenario knobs vs the existing
cfgs): every existing cfg pins `has_orphan_results = FALSE`,
`is_model_only = FALSE`, `sufficiency_state = SUFF_NA` via
`DefaultScenarioPins` — so V6..V12 are vacuously true on every
state those cfgs explore. The scenario cfgs vary exactly one knob
at a time with the others pinned to defaults, so V6..V12 fire
non-vacuously where each one's premise matches its target
scenario. The product space `(envelope, has_orphan_results,
is_model_only, sufficiency_state)` is therefore covered
exhaustively in its INVARIANT-RELEVANT subspace:

  - envelope dimension exhaustively covered by the existing
    Config-1 sub-split + Config-2 (every `key_source` × bundle ×
    pins combination);
  - scenario dimension covered by the four scenario cfgs (each
    scenario value, on a representative envelope).

The scenario cfgs do NOT declare `VIEW AuditView` (their state
spaces are small enough not to need the reduction). The new
invariants' call graphs still obey the AuditView (in)equality
discipline — `check_audit_view_faithful.py` walks them too via
`_SCENARIO_CFGS`, so a future cfg that combines scenario
variation WITH the VIEW reduction inherits the proven faithfulness
without script edit.

## CI job split

The audit-spec TLC work runs in a **dedicated `audit-tlc` job** in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, parallel to `test` and
`test-spec-invariants`:

- `audit-tlc` owns the `check_audit_view_faithful.py` AST-proof gate
  (it certifies the lossless `AuditView` reduction these two configs
  depend on), the TLC download, and the two `audit.tla` configs
  (`audit_main.cfg` Config 1 + `audit_bundle_bind.cfg` Config 2),
  both with `-workers auto`.
- `test` keeps the Python BFS cross-check and the
  `VerificationPipeline` / `KeySourceResolver` TLC runs.

Rationale: a long-but-correct audit TLC run no longer sits on the
critical path of the fast unit/BFS suite. No gate is weakened — every
job (`test`, `audit-tlc`, `test-spec-invariants`) remains a required
status check; the AST proof still fails closed; `-workers auto` and
the JVM tuning are unchanged.

## Companion: resolver-side invariant index

The issuer-side `KeySourceResolver.tla` carries its own invariant set
(`R1`–`R6`, `R10`, `R12` + `R3a`), indexed in that module's header.
The `customer_dsse` key-source classification adds **`R12` —
Customer-DSSE binding integrity**: the `customer_dsse` class fires iff
a stored workspace key resolves the fingerprint AND a valid
customer-signed DSSE bundle re-verifies against it (and no valid
Sigstore bundle is present, which still wins by precedence); it must
carry the dsse_bundle, stored public key, and workspace id and must
not be an orphan, while the bare-key `workspace` class must never
carry a dsse_bundle. This is a resolver invariant, not part of the
`audit.tla` `bundle_bind` partition above — it is checked by
`KeySourceResolver.cfg` (and the companion Python BFS), independently
of the two audit configs.

On the verifier side, `audit.tla` adds `KS_CUSTOMER_DSSE` to
`KeySources` in the same trust-anchor class as `KS_SIGSTORE` (the
customer-signed DSSE Statement, verified offline against an
out-of-band-pinned fingerprint, is the anchor — the envelope ws_sig
is not re-evaluated). It is added to the `KS_SIGSTORE`-style ws_sig
skip sets and to `I9`'s skip set.

### Customer-DSSE identity-pin scoping

The customer-keyed offline DSSE path gates identity **solely** on the
auditor's `--expected-customer-key` fingerprint pin (the
vendor-independence gate, `customer_dsse_verifier.py` step 3). It does
**not** engage the Sigstore-SAN identity pins (`--expected-ci-identity`
/ the resolved-issuer pin) nor the `--expected-workspace-key` pin —
there is no Sigstore bundle to bind a SAN to, and the customer-DSSE
CLI branch never consults the workspace-key pin. The model_id /
commit_sha predicate pins ARE enforced, but against the
customer-signed DSSE predicate, not a Sigstore bundle.

`audit.tla` models this with a key_source-aware refinement that is
**additive** (no behaviour change for sigstore / platform / workspace
/ orphan / legacy):

- A `KS_CUSTOMER_DSSE` *terminal dispatch* in the `Audit` operator
  (placed after the `I2` workspace-pin fail, mirroring the CLI's
  `customer_dsse_handled` branch): an `--expected-customer-key`
  fingerprint mismatch ⇒ `FAILED`; a model_id / commit_sha pin not
  matching the customer-signed predicate ⇒ `FAILED`; otherwise the
  key_source-independent canonical-hash check decides
  (`VERIFIED` / `FAILED`).
- The Sigstore-identity pin clauses are scoped out of customer_dsse:
  `I1` (bundle-binding-pin-is-binding) and `I7`'s predicate-co-pin
  clause carve out customer_dsse; `I4` (workspace-fp bound) carves it
  out; the `Audit` operator's SAN-less-co-pin / I1-omission /
  SAN-match / workspace-fp branches all gain `~IsCustomerDsse(k)`
  guards. `I7`'s **issuer-explicit-alone** clause stays
  key_source-unconditional (a bare `--expected-issuer` is a usage
  error regardless of key_source).
- Three new invariants positively state the customer_dsse pinned
  property: **`V5a`** (a customer-key fingerprint-pin mismatch must
  FAIL), **`V5b`** (a match + a producer-valid customer-signed DSSE
  row + intact canonical hash + matching predicate pins ⇒ VERIFIED,
  *even when* a SAN or workspace-fp pin is set), and **`V5c`** (a
  customer_dsse row's verdict is invariant under the SAN pin — the
  Sigstore-identity pins provably do not gate it).

The `KS_CUSTOMER_DSSE` producer contract from `KeySourceResolver.tla`
`R12` (the class fires only when no valid Sigstore bundle is present
and a valid customer-signed DSSE bundle re-verifies) is imported into
`InitBase`: a customer_dsse row has `bundle = ABSENT` and a
producer-valid envelope ws_sig (`valid = TRUE`). Because
`bundle = ABSENT`, `bundle_bind` is pinned `NONE/NONE` and the
customer_dsse invariants are `bundle_bind`-independent — they live in
Config 1's partition, and `ConfigMainCompositionLemma` (premise
`pkg.bundle # ABSENT`) is vacuous on customer_dsse rows. The
refinement therefore introduces no new `bundle_bind`-dependent premise
or conclusion, so the partition argument and
`ConfigMainCompositionLemma` above remain sound unchanged.

## `AuditView` — lossless two-sided Rel3 state-space reduction

The `customer_dsse` modeling added three `WSSig` fields —
`customer_key_fp_match : BOOLEAN`,
`dsse_predicate_model_id : ModelIds ∪ {NONE}`,
`dsse_predicate_commit_sha : CommitShas ∪ {NONE}`. On a customer_dsse
row the auditor's `model_id` / `commit_sha` pins are cross-checked
against the customer-signed DSSE predicate (the `dsse_predicate_*`
fields), so the reachable state space carries the **full
cross-product**

```
(dsse_predicate_model_id × pins.model_id)
  × (dsse_predicate_commit_sha × pins.commit_sha)
  × customer_key_fp_match
= 3·3 · 3·3 · 2 = 162 raw combinations
```

multiplied into the rest of the audit space, on top of the already
symmetry-reduced graph. With this product present, TLC on
`audit_main.cfg` / `audit_bundle_bind.cfg` ran 2h+ with no progress
checkpoint (effectively non-terminating in CI).

### The reduction

`AuditView` (defined in `audit.tla`, wired via `VIEW AuditView` in
both cfgs) is a **key-source-conditional** TLC view:

- **On a `customer_dsse` row** (`IsCustomerDsse(pkg)`, THEN branch):
  it projects the pair `(dsse_predicate_model_id, pins.model_id)` to
  a 3-valued relation token via `Rel3` — `q_none` (pin unset) /
  `match` / `mismatch` — does the same for
  `(dsse_predicate_commit_sha, pins.commit_sha)`, keeps
  `customer_key_fp_match` verbatim (a boolean), and keeps **every
  other observable field of `pkg`/`pins` verbatim**. The 162-way raw
  product collapses to `2·3·3 = 18` observable classes.
- **On a NON-customer_dsse row with `bundle # ABSENT`** (the
  Sigstore / bundle class, ELSE-then branch): it projects the pair
  `(pkg.bundle.predicate_model_id, pins.model_id)` to a 3-valued
  `Rel3` token, does the same for
  `(pkg.bundle.predicate_commit_sha, pins.commit_sha)`, drops those
  four identities, and keeps **every other field of
  `pkg`/`bundle`/`pins` verbatim**. The `3·3·3·3` predicate × pin
  raw cross-product collapses to `3·3 = 9` observable classes. This
  is the **two-sided extension**: the symmetric twin of the
  customer_dsse collapse, on the previously-identity Sigstore class
  that was the dominant Config-1 state-mass bottleneck.
- **On a NON-customer_dsse row with `bundle = ABSENT`** (and when
  `ws_sig = ABSENT`): the view is the **identity** `<<pkg, pins>>`,
  bit-for-bit unchanged from the pre-extension view on this subcase.

### Why the two-sided collapse is sound

Both branches discharge the **same** factor-through obligation.
Across the `Audit` operator and **every** cfg invariant — every
`Audit` invocation is `Audit(pkg, pins)`, so `q ≡ pins` — the bundle
predicate fields are observed **only** through (in)equality against
the pins or the `NONE` sentinel:

- `pkg.bundle.predicate_model_id # q.model_id` (`Audit`:481–482),
  guarded by `q.model_id # NONE`;
- `pkg.bundle.predicate_model_id = pins.model_id` (`I12`), guarded
  by `pins.model_id # NONE`;
- symmetric for `predicate_commit_sha` (`Audit`:486–487, `I13`);
- `pins.model_id` / `pins.commit_sha` are otherwise read **only**
  via `# NONE` / `= NONE` (`I1`/`I7`/`V3` …) — a relation the
  `Rel3` token's `q_none` class preserves exactly.

So a bundle-present non-customer_dsse row's contribution to every
invariant **factors through**
`<Rel3(bundle.predicate_model_id, pins.model_id),
Rel3(bundle.predicate_commit_sha, pins.commit_sha)>` exactly as a
customer_dsse row factors through the `dsse_predicate_*` tokens —
collapsing it is lossless, not merely dedup-equivalent.

The **bundle-absent** non-customer_dsse subcase stays the literal
identity: there is no bundle predicate (every bundle-predicate /
`I12` / `I13` read is guarded by `bundle # ABSENT` and is vacuous),
and `pins.model_id` / `pins.commit_sha` are observed there only via
`# NONE` / `= NONE` with no predicate to fold them into — so keeping
them verbatim is the only sound choice and preserves behaviour
exactly. A *global* (bundle-absent included) pins collapse would be
**unsound** for the same reason it was before the extension; the
extension narrows the identity region to exactly that subcase rather
than the whole Sigstore class.

### Lossless by construction — the AST proof

A TLC `VIEW` is lossless iff every checked invariant *factors
through* the view (two states with the same view agree on every
invariant). `formal/check_audit_view_faithful.py` **proves** this by
a stdlib-only structural analysis of `audit.tla`:

1. Parse every top-level operator; resolve the operator-call graph
   transitively from the `INVARIANTS` roots of both cfgs (an
   invariant calling a helper that touches a collapsed field counts).
2. For every reference to a collapsed field
   (`dsse_predicate_model_id`, `dsse_predicate_commit_sha`, the
   Sigstore bundle `predicate_model_id` / `predicate_commit_sha`,
   `customer_key_fp_match`, and the `.model_id` / `.commit_sha`
   pins) inside any invariant-reachable operator body, classify its
   immediate syntactic context and **assert** it is an operand of an
   (in)equality operator (`=`, `#`, `/=`) or — for the boolean —
   used as a boolean. Arithmetic, ordering (`<`,`>`,`<=`,`>=`),
   function application exposing identity, and identity-distinguishing
   set membership all FAIL. Any reference not *positively* provable
   safe FAILS (sound over-approximation: unprovable ⇒ unsafe).

Because every invariant observes the collapsed quantities **only via
(in)equality / boolean-as-boolean**, each invariant's truth value is
a function of the 3-valued relation token and the kept boolean —
i.e. it factors through `AuditView`. The reduction therefore loses
no invariant violation: it is **lossless by construction**, and the
script is the machine-checked proof. The AST analyzer is a sound
over-approximation (it never passes a reference it cannot prove
safe) and is non-vacuous (a negative self-test confirms it flags an
injected arithmetic/ordering use of a collapsed field).

### Generation-time twin: the InitBase relation-class canonicalisation

A TLC `VIEW` collapses the *seen / state-queue* set but TLC still
**generates** every raw `InitBase` tuple before applying the view —
so the customer_dsse predicate × pin cross-product remained the
residual *generation* blow-up (init-state enumeration never reached
the BFS phase where the view's benefit applies). `InitBase`
therefore also pins the customer_dsse predicate fields to a
**canonical representative of each reachable relation class**, by the
*same* faithfulness property the AST proof establishes:

- `pins.model_id = NONE` ⇒ the relation is `q_none` for every
  predicate value ⇒ `dsse_predicate_model_id = NONE` (1 generated
  rep, was 3).
- `pins.model_id # NONE` ⇒ only `match`
  (`dsse_predicate_model_id = pins.model_id`) and `mismatch` are
  reachable; `NONE` is a canonical mismatch witness
  (`NONE # any non-NONE pin`), so the predicate ranges over
  `{pins.model_id, NONE}` — exactly the two classes (2 reps, was 3).
- Symmetric for `commit_sha`.

This is **lossless, not merely dedup-equivalent**: because every
invariant's verdict is a proven function of
`Rel3(dsse_predicate_*, pins.*)` alone (the AST proof), every dropped
predicate value is relation-equivalent to a retained representative
and yields an identical verdict on every invariant — so omitting it
from *generation* changes no checked property. It is the standard
canonical-representative `InitBase` pruning (same pattern as the
pre-existing dead-field pins), certified by
`check_audit_view_faithful.py` rather than asserted. The `VIEW`
is retained — it is the formal lossless artifact under review and
still collapses the residual successor/seen-set space; the
`InitBase` canonicalisation is its generation-time twin so TLC
actually terminates in tractable time.

### Corroborated by a mutation test

As an independent empirical check that the view does not mask
regressions: a customer_dsse invariant is deliberately broken (the
`Audit` terminal-dispatch clause `~customer_key_fp_match ⇒ FAILED`
weakened so a mismatched customer key no longer fails) and TLC is
re-run **with the view active**. TLC still reports an invariant
violation (`V5a_CustomerDssePinMismatchFails` counterexample),
proving the view did not hide the regression. Reverting the mutation
restores a clean run. See the final-report record of the
before/after TLC output.

The two-sided extension adds a proof-side non-vacuity check: a
structural (`\in`) use of the newly-collapsed
`pkg.bundle.predicate_model_id` is transiently injected into `I12`
and `check_audit_view_faithful.py` is confirmed to **FAIL** within
seconds (it flags the non-(in)equality use of a collapsed field),
then reverted. This proves the extended AST proof actually
constrains the bundle predicate fields rather than passing them
vacuously.

### Residual soundness assumption

The faithfulness proof reasons over `audit.tla`'s source structure:
it assumes the spec uses the standard TLA+ operators it tokenizes
(`=`, `#`, `/=`, `\/`, `/\`, `~`, `=>`, `\in`, etc.) and does not
hide an identity-exposing observation of a collapsed field behind a
construct the tokenizer does not model (e.g. a user-defined operator
that returns one of the collapsed fields unequal-tested). The
call-graph closure and the conservative "unprovable ⇒ unsafe" rule
bound this: a new helper that touched a collapsed field unsafely
would have to do so via one of the classified syntactic shapes (and
fail) or via an unmodeled construct (and the analyzer, being
conservative on unknown contexts, fails closed). The mutation test
provides orthogonal empirical assurance.
