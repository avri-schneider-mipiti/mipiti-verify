\* I1 — any bundle-binding pin (SAN, model_id, commit_sha) requires
\* Sigstore evidence. A compromised platform must not be able to
\* bypass the pin by omitting the bundle. All three pins reduce to
\* the same property: the bundle's signed material is what's pinned
\* against, so omitting the bundle defeats the pin.
\*
\* The conclusion allows USAGE_ERROR alongside FAILED because I7
\* (predicate-pin-without-SAN, issuer-without-SAN) returns
\* USAGE_ERROR before I1's FAILED branch fires. Both verdicts are
\* non-positive — the safety property is preserved either way.

\* I2 — workspace pin requires content_integrity evidence.
\* Same I7-co-occurrence allowance as I1: when the auditor also has
\* a co-pin without SAN, USAGE_ERROR fires before the workspace
\* check; conclusion widens to admit it.
I2_WorkspacePinIsBinding ==
    (pins.workspace_fp # NONE /\ pkg.ws_sig = ABSENT)
    => Audit(pkg, pins) \in {"FAILED", "USAGE_ERROR"}

\* I3 — issuer is never sourced from the bundle's own claim. When a
\* bundle is present and the auditor's expected issuer (resolved from
\* pins) differs from the bundle's claim, the audit must FAIL. (The
\* contrapositive: VERIFIED with bundle present implies bundle.issuer
\* equals the auditor's expected issuer, not the bundle's self-claim.)

\* I4 — workspace fingerprint must equal the canonical fingerprint of
\* the public key actually used for verification (signing_key_fp), not
\* the package's claim. Forged-key attacks must FAIL.
\* Allows USAGE_ERROR for the same reason as I1/I2 (I7 fires first

\* I7 — any pin whose enforcement requires the SAN pin (issuer
\* explicit, model_id, commit_sha) without a SAN pin is a usage
\* error. policy.Identity needs both SAN+issuer; predicate pins
\* without SAN deliver no compromised-platform defense because an
\* attacker minting under their own OIDC controls the predicate.

\* I8 — bundle present + positive verdict ⇒ bundle's bound_hash
\* equals the package's claimed results_hash. Defense-in-depth on
\* top of Sigstore's verify_artifact, which raises when the bundle's
\* Subject digest doesn't equal sha256(input_). With the malformed-
\* bundle (no results_hash) case now an unconditional FAILED in the
\* Audit operator, this invariant holds without an ws_sig=ABSENT
\* exception.

\* I9 — VERIFIED requires every present signature to verify, not just
\* one. I5 alone is too weak: it allows VERIFIED when ANY signature
\* is valid, even if a co-located other signature is invalid. The
\* implementation correctly fails when any present signature fails;
\* I9 captures that property explicitly.
\*
\* Refined for the key_source discriminator: when the issuer marks
\* a ws_sig as KS_SIGSTORE (its validity is redundant — Sigstore is
\* the trust anchor) or KS_ORPHAN (its validity is not decidable —
\* the key is not in the issuer's published set), ws_sig.valid is
\* not part of the VERIFIED preconditions. For KS_PLATFORM,
\* KS_WORKSPACE, and KS_LEGACY (older envelopes), ws_sig.valid
\* IS required as before — preserving the original property's
\* strength on every input shape it covered before.

\* I10 — a bundle present without a results_hash to bind to cannot
\* yield a positive verdict. With the strict malformed-bundle rule,
\* the Audit operator returns FAILED unconditionally for this case
\* — even when ws_sig is present and would otherwise verify. A
\* bundle in the package without its corresponding results_hash is
\* a malformed / tampered shape; refusing it ensures the auditor
\* doesn't see a "VERIFIED — content intact" verdict on a package
\* whose bundle was effectively ignored. USAGE_ERROR can still
\* preempt FAILED when an issuer-alone or predicate-pin-without-SAN
\* configuration is set.

\* I11 — VERIFIED with bundle present and SAN pin set implies the
\* bundle's SAN equals the pin. Symmetric counterpart of I3 for SAN:
\* I3 ensures issuer matches; I11 ensures SAN matches. Defense-in-
\* depth on top of policy.Identity's SAN check.
I11_BundleSanMatchesPin ==
    (Audit(pkg, pins) = "VERIFIED"

\* I12 — VERIFIED with bundle present and model_id pin set implies
\* the bundle's predicate model_id equals the pin. Defends against
\* cross-model substitution: a real, cryptographically-valid audit
\* package for a different model cannot be passed off as the
\* auditor's intended model. Pin-bypass-by-omission (no bundle while
\* model_id pin set) is enforced by the generalised I1 / step #2.
I12_BundleModelIdMatchesPin ==
    (Audit(pkg, pins) = "VERIFIED"
     /\ pkg.bundle # ABSENT
     /\ pins.model_id # NONE)
    => pkg.bundle.predicate_model_id = pins.model_id

\* I13 — VERIFIED with bundle present and commit_sha pin set implies
\* the bundle's predicate commit_sha equals the pin. Defends against
\* replay: a real, cryptographically-valid audit package from an
\* older verification run (different commit) cannot be passed off as
\* an audit of the release the auditor is certifying.
I13_BundleCommitShaMatchesPin ==

\* V1 — Sigstore-skip soundness. When the issuer marks a row's
\* ws_sig with key_source = KS_SIGSTORE, the verifier MUST NOT FAIL
\* the audit on ws_sig.valid alone (the sigstore bundle path is the
\* trust anchor; the ws_sig is the issuer's redundant notarization
\* and is intentionally skipped). VERIFIED in this case requires
\* the bundle path to succeed, captured by I9's refined conjunction.
\* The property captured here: if the only failing signature is a
\* sigstore-tagged ws_sig, the audit DOES NOT FAIL.

\* V2 — Orphan-with-bundle still verifiable. When the issuer marks a
\* row's ws_sig with key_source = KS_ORPHAN (fingerprint not in
\* published key set) and a Sigstore bundle is also present and
\* validly bound to the results, the verifier MUST still produce
\* VERIFIED via the bundle path. The orphan ws_sig's validity is
\* not consulted (mirrors V1's logic, but for the orphan case).

    => Audit(pkg, pins) = "VERIFIED"

\* V3 — Orphan + workspace pin = FAILED, unconditionally. When the
\* issuer marks a row's ws_sig with key_source = KS_ORPHAN, the
\* verifier has no resolvable public key to verify the signature
\* against. A metadata-level fingerprint match between the
\* envelope's claimed signing_key_fp and the auditor's pin is NOT
\* a cryptographic guarantee — admitting it as "pin satisfied"
\* would let a forger set claimed_fp = customer's pinned fp without
\* actually signing with the customer's key. So the audit MUST FAIL
\* whenever the auditor pinned workspace_fp on an orphan row,
\* regardless of fingerprint match. Generalises I2 (workspace pin
\* requires ws_sig present) to also reject ws_sig present-but-
\* orphan when the pin's intent (cryptographic verification against
\* a known workspace key) cannot be served.
