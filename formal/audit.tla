    \* --- KS_CUSTOMER_DSSE fields ---------------------------------
    \* The customer-keyed offline DSSE path has NO Sigstore bundle by
    \* construction (it exists precisely for air-gapped / non-Sigstore
    \* CI). The customer-signed in-toto Statement carried in the
    \* envelope's content_integrity.dsse_bundle is the trust anchor;
    \* the auditor binds it out-of-band via --expected-customer-key.
    \* These fields model the Statement + the auditor's customer-key
    \* fingerprint pin so the spec can state the pinned property
    \* positively. They are observable ONLY when
    \* key_source = KS_CUSTOMER_DSSE; for every other key_source they
    \* are pinned to canonical sentinels in InitBase (dead fields, no
    \* enumeration cost).
    \*
    \* dsse_predicate_model_id / dsse_predicate_commit_sha: the
    \* model_id / commit_sha signed inside the customer's DSSE
    \* predicate. The verifier cross-checks --expected-model-id /
    \* --expected-commit-sha against THESE (cli.py customer_dsse

    \* bundle (recomputed SHA-256 DER-SPKI fingerprint) equal the

    \* This is step 3 of verify_customer_dsse_bundle — THE
    \* vendor-independence gate and the sole identity binding for this
    \* key_source. The CLI fails closed when --expected-customer-key
    \* is absent, so a customer_dsse row is always evaluated against
    \* this pin; FALSE models a swapped / vendor-substituted key.

\* bundle_bind_signature outcomes — the verifier-side resolution and
\* signature check, modeled as a discriminated outcome rather than a
\* single BOOLEAN. The previous BOOLEAN form's comment claimed the
\* platform public key was "already embedded in the envelope"; that
\* precondition was asserted by the abstraction rather than checked,
\* and conflated two distinct verifier code paths into one bit:
\*
\*   1. signature was checked against a resolved key, ECDSA failed;
\*   2. signature could not be checked because no key was resolvable.
\*
\* Both produced the same FAILED verdict, but the second path is real
\* in production for envelope rows whose embedded public_key_pem is
\* intentionally empty (e.g. Sigstore key-source rows whose trust
\* anchor is the bundle, not an envelope-resident PEM). The verifier
\* now resolves the platform key from up to three sources, in order:
\* an explicit auditor-supplied --platform-pubkey; the platform key
\* already resolved by the PDF outer-signature path; the envelope's
\* own public_key_pem. KEY_UNRESOLVABLE captures the case where none
\* of the three apply — the signature is present but the verifier
\* has no key to evaluate it against, and FAILS rather than silently
\* skipping the check.

\* ---- Generation-time customer_dsse pruning for Config 2 -----------
\* PackageGen(gen) is the set TLC ENUMERATES at Init. With gen = TRUE
\* it is exactly `Package` (Config 1 / audit.cfg — byte-equivalent,
\* customer_dsse fully generated). With gen = FALSE (Config 2) the
\* WSSig generator drops KS_CUSTOMER_DSSE from `key_source` and pins
\* the three customer_dsse-ONLY fields to their canonical sentinels —
\* so TLC's `\in` enumerator generates ~18x fewer WSSig records
\* (3 * 3 * 2 collapsed to 1 * 1 * 1, KeySources 6 -> 5). This is a
\* genuine generation-domain restriction (membership in a smaller
\* set), NOT a post-`\in` filter — TLC never materialises the
\* customer_dsse sub-product.
\*
\* Lossless (COMPOSITION.md "Config-2 customer_dsse exclusion"):
\* every invariant Config 2 checks (I8/I14/V1/V2/V4, + TypeOK)
\* requires pkg.bundle # ABSENT in its premise, and a customer_dsse
\* row has bundle = ABSENT (KeySourceResolver R12, imported in
\* InitBase), so every dropped customer_dsse state is vacuously-true
\* for all Config-2 invariants and contributes zero coverage. The
\* dropped customer_dsse-only field values are likewise unobserved on
\* the surviving non-customer_dsse rows (the pre-existing InitBase
\* dead-field pin already canonicalises them there). Config 1
\* (Init_main) uses gen = TRUE and keeps customer_dsse — V5a/V5b/V5c
\* live in its partition and need it.
\* Set-parameterized row generators. Take an explicit set of allowed
\* `key_source` values so each Config-1 sub-config (audit_main_*.cfg)
\* can pin enumeration to its own key_source class — the bulk of the
\* Config-1 sub-split speedup. customer_dsse-specific fields are
\* dead-field-pinned when KS_CUSTOMER_DSSE is excluded from
\* allowedKS, identical semantics to the legacy boolean form's
\* pinning when gen=FALSE.

\*     bundle = ABSENT — lifting it into generation just elides
\*     enumeration of states the post-filter would have discarded.

    \* pins are signed by Fulcio, but Fulcio signs whatever predicate
    \* the OIDC-token-holder supplies; without a SAN pin constraining
    \* whose OIDC was used, the predicate pins offer no compromised-
    \* platform defense (the flag's documented purpose).
    \*
    \* key_source-aware carve-out for KS_CUSTOMER_DSSE: the customer-
    \* keyed offline DSSE path binds verification to a specific key via
    \* the auditor's --expected-customer-key fingerprint pin, which is
    \* the SAN-substitute for this key_source (cli.py line ~1866). So a
    \* model_id / commit_sha co-pin WITHOUT a SAN is NOT a usage error
    \* for customer_dsse — the predicate is signed by the customer's
    \* own pinned key, so the predicate pins are meaningful. But
    \* --expected-issuer alone is STILL a usage error regardless of

    \*
    \* key_source-aware carve-out for KS_CUSTOMER_DSSE: a customer-keyed

    \* `not _has_dsse`) and instead enforces the predicate pins against
    \* the customer-signed Statement in the customer_dsse branch below.
    \* So a SAN / model_id / commit_sha pin + no Sigstore bundle is NOT

    \* The customer-keyed offline DSSE path is resolved here in full,

    \* the I1 / SAN-less-co-pin branches were carved out for
    \* customer_dsse. What remains is the customer-DSSE contract:
    \*
    \*   1. Identity gate: the auditor's --expected-customer-key
    \*      fingerprint pin must match the key that signed the DSSE
    \*      bundle (verify_customer_dsse_bundle step 3 — the
    \*      vendor-independence gate). Mismatch ⇒ FAILED. This is the
    \*      SOLE identity binding for this key_source; the Sigstore-SAN
    \*      pins and the workspace-fp pin do NOT gate it.
    \*   2. Predicate pins: --expected-model-id / --expected-commit-sha
    \*      are cross-checked against the CUSTOMER-signed DSSE
    \*      predicate (dsse_predicate_*), not a Sigstore bundle.
    \*      Mismatch ⇒ FAILED.
    \*   3. Otherwise, with the offline-verified customer-signed
    \*      Statement as the trust anchor and the canonical content
    \*      hash intact, the row is VERIFIED. The key_source-independent
    \*      results_hash canonical-hash check still applies (a tampered
    \*      results_hash ⇒ FAILED) — it is enforced uniformly further

\* and "dead signature when bind FAILED" pruning the original spec
\* enforced. Compositional split refines this into two narrower init
\* predicates below; each .cfg picks one Spec.
\* InitBase(genCustomerDsse) — shared init skeleton, parameterised on
\* whether customer_dsse rows are GENERATED.
\*
\*   - genCustomerDsse = TRUE  (Config 1 / audit.cfg): customer_dsse
\*     rows are generated; the R12 producer constraint and the
\*     relation-class canonicalisation apply (V5a/V5b/V5c need them).
\*   - genCustomerDsse = FALSE (Config 2 / audit_bundle_bind.cfg):
\*     customer_dsse is excluded at GENERATION time via PackageGen
\*     (FALSE): the enumerated WSSig set drops KS_CUSTOMER_DSSE and
\*     pins the three customer_dsse-only fields to singletons, so
\*     TLC's `\in` enumerator never materialises the customer_dsse
\*     sub-product (true domain restriction, not a post-filter). This
\*     is the lossless Config-2 customer_dsse exclusion
\*     (COMPOSITION.md): every invariant Config 2 checks
\*     (I8/I14/V1/V2/V4) requires pkg.bundle # ABSENT, and a
\*     customer_dsse row has bundle = ABSENT (R12), so every excluded
\*     state is vacuously-true for all Config-2 invariants.
\* Shared init constraints — everything except the `pkg ∈ <generator>`
\* enumeration choice. Factored out so InitBaseFor (set-parameterized
\* PackageGenFor) and Init_main_cdsse (cdsse-specific
\* PackageGenForCdsse) can BOTH apply the same producer-side
\* constraints without duplication. Every constraint below is per-
\* (pkg, pins)-row, so the partition into per-key_source sub-configs
\* simply enumerates a subset of rows — every constraint still holds
\* on each restricted row.
\* Scenario-default constraints — pin the three new state variables to
\* their canonical "nominal" values (no orphan results, not a PDF
\* model-only export, no sufficiency demotion). Used by every existing
\* cfg so the existing state spaces are byte-equivalent to the
\* pre-extension run; new cfgs override these per-variable to vary the
\* scenario. Each override is a single Init clause in the new cfg's
\* Init operator (additive, no edit to the existing operators).

    \* wins by precedence — and (b) a valid customer-signed DSSE
    \* bundle re-verifies against the resolved fingerprint, so the

    \* consumer spec so the BFS does not explore producer-impossible
    \* states (analogous to the R3a sigstore pin above): a
    \* customer_dsse row has bundle = ABSENT and the envelope ws_sig
    \* itself is well-formed (valid = TRUE — its validity is never
    \* re-evaluated by the verifier on this path; KeySourceResolver
    \* R12 only emits the class when the row is producer-valid).
    \* customer_key_fp_match is DELIBERATELY left free: it is the

    \* the residual generation blow-up. By the SAME faithfulness
    \* property the AuditView VIEW relies on (machine-proven by
    \* formal/check_audit_view_faithful.py): every invariant —
    \* transitively through Audit — observes dsse_predicate_model_id /
    \* dsse_predicate_commit_sha ONLY via (in)equality against
    \* pins.model_id / pins.commit_sha, so a customer_dsse row's
    \* verdict is a function of the 3-valued relation token
    \*   Rel3(dsse_predicate_*, pins.*) ∈ {q_none, match, mismatch}
    \* alone, NOT of the predicate's identity. It therefore suffices
    \* to GENERATE one canonical representative of each reachable
    \* relation class instead of the full predicate domain:
    \*   - pins.* = NONE  ⇒ relation is `q_none` for every predicate
    \*     value ⇒ pin the predicate to NONE (1 rep, was 3).
    \*   - pins.* # NONE   ⇒ only `match` (predicate = pin) and
    \*     `mismatch` are reachable; NONE is a canonical mismatch
    \*     witness (NONE # any non-NONE pin), so the predicate ranges
    \*     over {pins.*, NONE} — exactly the two classes, 2 reps
    \*     (was 3). Any other mismatch value is relation-equivalent to
    \*     the NONE witness and, by the proven faithfulness, yields an
    \*     identical verdict on every invariant — so dropping it from
    \*     *generation* is lossless, not merely dedup-equivalent.
    \* This is the standard canonical-representative InitBase pruning
    \* (same pattern as the dead-field pins above), certified lossless
    \* by the AuditView AST proof rather than asserted. The VIEW is
    \* retained: it is the formal lossless artifact under review and
    \* still collapses the residual successor/seen-set space.

    \* Sigstore/bundle relation-class canonicalisation — the

    \* cross-product on every bundle-present non-customer_dsse row;
    \* TLC enumerates raw InitBase tuples single-threaded BEFORE the
    \* VIEW applies, so the seen-set collapse alone left Config 1 at

    \* `predicate_commit_sha` are observed ONLY via `=`/`#`/`/=`
    \* against pins.model_id / pins.commit_sha or NONE, in Audit
    \* (q ≡ pins) and I12/I13), every bundle-present row's verdict
    \* is a function of
    \*   Rel3(bundle.predicate_*, pins.*) ∈ {q_none, match, mismatch}
    \* alone, NOT of the predicate's identity — so generating one

    \*     the bundle predicate to NONE (1 rep, was 3).

    \*     witness (NONE # any non-NONE pin), so the predicate ranges
    \*     over {pins.*, NONE} — exactly the two classes (2 reps,
    \*     was 3). Any other mismatch value is relation-equivalent
    \*     to the NONE witness and yields an identical verdict on
    \*     every invariant by the proven faithfulness.
    \* A customer_dsse row has bundle = ABSENT (R12), so the

\* Init_bind — init for audit_bundle_bind.cfg, the **Config 2** half
\* of the compositional split (bundle_bind cross-product explored, vs
\* Config 1's bundle_bind-pinned half realized as the 5 per-key_source
\* sub-configs audit_main_*.cfg). "Config 2" is a conceptual label for
\* the bundle_bind-explored partition, not a sibling cfg filename.
\*
\* Full bundle_bind cross-product preserved (this is what Config 2
\* exists to verify) and full ws_sig variation preserved (V1/V2
\* preconditions require ws_sig present with specific key_source
\* values). Pins are pinned to NONE since V1/V2's premises require
\* all pins NONE, and I8/I14 are independent of pins.
\*
\* Lossless customer_dsse exclusion (see formal/COMPOSITION.md
\* "Config-2 customer_dsse exclusion"). Every invariant Config 2
\* checks — I8, I14, V1, V2, V4 (and TypeOK) — has a premise conjunct
\* requiring `pkg.bundle # ABSENT`. A customer_dsse row has
\* `pkg.bundle = ABSENT` (KeySourceResolver R12 producer constraint,
\* imported in InitBase lines ~601-603), so on every customer_dsse
\* state all five Config-2 invariant premises are vacuously false and
\* the invariants hold trivially — customer_dsse states contribute
\* zero coverage to Config 2. None of I8/I14/V1/V2/V4 reference
\* KS_CUSTOMER_DSSE / dsse_predicate_* / customer_key_fp_match /
\* IsCustomerDsse in their own bodies (only the shared, invariant-
\* agnostic Audit/WSSig/KeySources infrastructure does). Excluding
\* customer_dsse rows from generation is therefore lossless for
\* Config 2 — it drops only states on which every checked invariant
\* is vacuously true — and collapses Config 2 back to its
\* pre-customer_dsse magnitude. Config 1 (Init_main) legitimately
\* keeps customer_dsse: V5a/V5b/V5c live in its partition and need it.
\*
\* The exclusion is enforced at *generation* time, not as a
\* post-filter. InitBase(FALSE) enumerates `pkg \in PackageGen(FALSE)`
\* (defined next to Package), whose WSSig generator already DROPS
\* KS_CUSTOMER_DSSE from `key_source` and pins the three
\* customer_dsse-only fields to singletons — so TLC's `\in`
\* enumerator generates ~18x fewer WSSig records and never
\* materialises the customer_dsse sub-product. A bare conjunctive
\* `key_source # KS_CUSTOMER_DSSE` AFTER an unparameterised
\* `pkg \in Package` would NOT prune generation (TLC still iterates
\* the full record product, then discards) — empirically the
\* init-generation blow-up the AuditView / InitBase-canon work
\* documents. PackageGen(FALSE) ⊆ Package, so TypeOK still holds on
\* every Config-2 state. Measured: Config 2 completes in ~3.5 min /
\* 142,743 distinct states (was multi-hour / non-terminating).

(***************************************************************************)

\* I1 — any bundle-binding pin (SAN, model_id, commit_sha) requires
\* Sigstore evidence. A compromised platform must not be able to
\* bypass the pin by omitting the bundle. All three pins reduce to
\* the same property: the bundle's signed material is what's pinned
\* against, so omitting the bundle defeats the pin.
\*
\* The conclusion allows USAGE_ERROR alongside FAILED because I7
\* (predicate-pin-without-SAN, issuer-without-SAN) returns
\* USAGE_ERROR before I1's FAILED branch fires. Both verdicts are
\* non-positive — the safety property is preserved either way.
\*
\* key_source scoping: this invariant governs the key_sources whose
\* pinned material lives in a SIGSTORE bundle (sigstore / platform /
\* workspace / orphan / legacy). KS_CUSTOMER_DSSE is excluded — it
\* carries its OWN upstream evidence (the customer-signed in-toto
\* Statement) and has no Sigstore bundle by construction, so
\* "omitting the bundle" is not pin-bypass for that key_source. The
\* corresponding positive property for customer_dsse — that its
\* identity binding is the --expected-customer-key fingerprint pin,
\* not a SAN / predicate-without-key pin — is stated by V5a/V5b. The
\* exclusion is additive: I1's strength on every key_source it
\* governed before is unchanged.

    => Audit(pkg, pins) \in {"FAILED", "USAGE_ERROR"}

\* I2 — workspace pin requires content_integrity evidence.
\* Same I7-co-occurrence allowance as I1: when the auditor also has
\* a co-pin without SAN, USAGE_ERROR fires before the workspace
\* check; conclusion widens to admit it.
I2_WorkspacePinIsBinding ==
    (pins.workspace_fp # NONE /\ pkg.ws_sig = ABSENT)
    => Audit(pkg, pins) \in {"FAILED", "USAGE_ERROR"}

\* I3 — issuer is never sourced from the bundle's own claim. When a
\* bundle is present and the auditor's expected issuer (resolved from
\* pins) differs from the bundle's claim, the audit must FAIL. (The
\* contrapositive: VERIFIED with bundle present implies bundle.issuer
\* equals the auditor's expected issuer, not the bundle's self-claim.)

\* I4 — workspace fingerprint must equal the canonical fingerprint of
\* the public key actually used for verification (signing_key_fp), not
\* the package's claim. Forged-key attacks must FAIL.
\* Allows USAGE_ERROR for the same reason as I1/I2 (I7 fires first
\* when a co-pin is set without SAN).
\*
\* key_source scoping: --expected-workspace-key governs the ECDSA
\* workspace-signature path (platform / workspace / legacy) and the
\* orphan case (V3). KS_CUSTOMER_DSSE is excluded — the customer-DSSE
\* CLI path never consults --expected-workspace-key; its identity
\* binding is the --expected-customer-key fingerprint pin (V5a/V5b).
\* Pinning workspace_fp on a customer_dsse row is a no-op for that
\* pin, not a forged-key signal, so the FAILED conclusion does not
\* apply. The exclusion is additive: I4's strength on every
\* key_source it governed before is unchanged.

\* I7 — any pin whose enforcement requires the SAN pin (issuer
\* explicit, model_id, commit_sha) without a SAN pin is a usage
\* error. policy.Identity needs both SAN+issuer; predicate pins
\* without SAN deliver no compromised-platform defense because an
\* attacker minting under their own OIDC controls the predicate.
\*
\* key_source scoping for the predicate co-pins: --expected-model-id
\* / --expected-commit-sha without a SAN pin is a usage error for
\* the Sigstore-bundle key_sources, but NOT for KS_CUSTOMER_DSSE —
\* --expected-customer-key is the SAN-substitute for the customer-
\* keyed offline DSSE path (cli.py line ~1866): the predicate is
\* signed by the customer's own pinned key, so the predicate pins
\* ARE meaningful there. The issuer-explicit-alone clause stays
\* key_source-UNCONDITIONAL: --expected-issuer needs a SAN to bind
\* to regardless of key_source (cli.py line ~1840), so a bare issuer
\* pin is a usage error even for customer_dsse. V5b states the
\* corresponding positive property (customer_dsse with matched
\* predicate pins and a matched customer key VERIFIES). The scoping
\* is additive: I7's strength on every key_source it governed before
\* is unchanged for the issuer clause, and unchanged for the
\* predicate clause on every key_source except the one the CLI
\* explicitly carves out.

\* I9 — VERIFIED requires every present signature to verify, not just
\* one. I5 alone is too weak: it allows VERIFIED when ANY signature
\* is valid, even if a co-located other signature is invalid. The
\* implementation correctly fails when any present signature fails;
\* I9 captures that property explicitly.
\*
\* Refined for the key_source discriminator: when the issuer marks
\* a ws_sig as KS_SIGSTORE (its validity is redundant — Sigstore is
\* the trust anchor), KS_CUSTOMER_DSSE (the offline-verified
\* customer-signed DSSE Statement is the trust anchor — same
\* trust-anchor class as KS_SIGSTORE), or KS_ORPHAN (its validity is
\* not decidable — the key is not in the issuer's published set),
\* ws_sig.valid is not part of the VERIFIED preconditions. For
\* KS_PLATFORM, KS_WORKSPACE, and KS_LEGACY (older envelopes),
\* ws_sig.valid IS required as before — preserving the original

\* bundle in the package without its corresponding results_hash is
\* a malformed / tampered shape; refusing it ensures the auditor

\* whose bundle was effectively ignored. USAGE_ERROR can still

\* present, it must be valid. The verifier compares both values
\* directly with no canonicalisation, no rehashing — the contract is
\* "envelope says X, bundle was signed over X." Defends against:
\*   - issuer-side regressions where the binding value is computed
\*     differently on signing vs verifying sides;
\*   - silent acceptance of a bundle whose Subject digest doesn't
\*     match anything the envelope explicitly commits to;

\* V1 — Sigstore-skip soundness. When the issuer marks a row's

\* the audit on ws_sig.valid alone (the sigstore bundle path is the
\* trust anchor; the ws_sig is the issuer's redundant notarization
\* and is intentionally skipped). VERIFIED in this case requires
\* the bundle path to succeed, captured by I9's refined conjunction.

\* V3 — Orphan + workspace pin = FAILED, unconditionally. When the

\* verifier has no resolvable public key to verify the signature
\* against. A metadata-level fingerprint match between the
\* envelope's claimed signing_key_fp and the auditor's pin is NOT
\* a cryptographic guarantee — admitting it as "pin satisfied"
\* would let a forger set claimed_fp = customer's pinned fp without
\* actually signing with the customer's key. So the audit MUST FAIL
\* whenever the auditor pinned workspace_fp on an orphan row,
\* regardless of fingerprint match. Generalises I2 (workspace pin
\* requires ws_sig present) to also reject ws_sig present-but-
\* orphan when the pin's intent (cryptographic verification against

\* V4 — Bundle-bind-signature key resolution must be explicit.
\*
\* When the envelope carries a bundle and the bundle-bind signature
\* is present, the verifier MUST evaluate the signature against a
\* resolved platform public key. If no key is resolvable from any
\* tier (auditor-supplied --platform-pubkey, PDF outer-signature
\* pubkey, or envelope-embedded public_key_pem), the verifier MUST
\* fail the audit rather than silently skipping the check.
\*
\* This invariant exists to close a class of bug where a previous
\* BOOLEAN abstraction of bundle_bind_signature conflated "the
\* signature failed crypto" with "the verifier had no key to check
\* against." Both produced the same FAILED verdict in Audit, but the
\* implementation could enter the second state at runtime and either
\* silently skip the check or crash with a confusing error. The
\* discriminated outcome (KEY_UNRESOLVABLE) makes the gap state
\* observable to TLC and to the BFS bridge, and pins the verifier
\* to fail-loud with a remediation message.

\* V5 — Customer-keyed offline DSSE: the identity binding under a pin

\* `customer_dsse` branch + customer_dsse_verifier.py step 3); the
\* spec must model it rather than over-constrain customer_dsse with
\* the Sigstore-identity pins it does not engage.
\*
\* V5a — --expected-customer-key pin MISMATCH must FAIL. The
\* fingerprint pin is the entire trust basis for this key_source

\* C1 — Composition lemma for Config 1.
\*
\* Asserts that, on every state in Config 1's pinned domain, Audit's
\* verdict is INDEPENDENT of the bundle_bind dimension. Operationally:
\* substitute every alternative bundle_bind value into the state, and
\* compare Audit's verdict on the substituted state to Audit's verdict
\* on the canonical (matching) representative — they must produce the
\* same verdict for invariants Config 1 cares about.
\*
\* This is the Flavor 1 composition check: TLC mechanically verifies
\* that pinning bundle_bind to "matching, valid" in Config 1 is
\* precision-preserving for the invariants in Config 1.
\*
\* The verdict equivalence allows for one structural difference: a
\* state with bundle_bind = mismatch produces Audit = FAILED via the
\* bundle-bind branch, while the canonical-matching representative
\* may produce a positive verdict. Config 1's invariants are
\* structured as "X => positive" or "X => negative" with X
\* independent of bundle_bind, so the verdict CLASS (positive vs
\* negative) is what matters — not the exact verdict value. We
\* check class equivalence on the canonical representative against
\* the canonical representative itself (trivially equal); the
\* meaningful work is checking that the alternative substitutions
\* land in the negative class via the bundle-bind branch.
